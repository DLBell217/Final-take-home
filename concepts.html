    The same-origin policy is a security measure implemented by web browsers that restricts interactions between resources (such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML) from different origins (domains, protocols, and ports). It prevents a web page or script from making requests to another domain unless they share the same origin, protecting users from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

<div class="title"> 26. three phases</div>
<button class="collapsible">Mounting</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    when a component is being initialized and inserted into the DOM. It involves the creation of the component instance, setting initial state and props, and rendering the component for the first time.
	</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Updating</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    when a component's state or props change. It involves re-rendering the component with updated data and potentially performing side effects such as fetching data or updating the DOM.
	</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">Unmounting</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    when a component is being removed from the DOM. It involves cleaning up any resources or event listeners associated with the component to prevent memory leaks or performance issues.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="title"> 27. React Hooks</div>
<button class="collapsible">useState</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    used to add state to functional components in React. It allows you to declare state variables and update them, triggering re-renders when the state changes.
	</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">useEffect</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    used to perform side effects in functional components. It allows you to execute code in response to component updates, such as fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, or updating the DOM.
	</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">useContext</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    used to access the context in functional components. It allows you to consume context values provided by a Context Provider higher up in the component tree without needing to pass props down manually.
	</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">useRef</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    used to create mutable references to DOM elements or other values that persist across renders. It allows you to access and modify the current value of a reference without causing re-renders.
	</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">useReducer </button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    used to manage complex state logic in functional components. It allows you to dispatch actions to update state based on the previous state, similar to how reducers work in Redux.
	</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">useCallback</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    used to memorize callback functions in functional components. It allows you to prevent unnecessary re-renders by memorizing the callback function when its dependencies haven't changed.
	</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">useMemo</button>
<div class="content">
	<p>
    used to memorize values in functional components. It allows you to memorize the result of expensive computations so that they are only recalculated when their dependencies change, improving performance.
	</p>
</div>
